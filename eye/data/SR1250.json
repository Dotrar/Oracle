{"title": "0-9 BCD Pushwheel ", "blurb": "These pushwheel switches can be ganged together to make any combination and can be panel mounted using the optional pair of endcaps (SR-1254). Switch positions (0 - 9) indicated via large numbers (white on black) and outputs are BCD coded. Optional spacers (SR-1256) can be ganged together to provide spacing (7.62mm each) between the switches.\nSwitching Current: 100mA Max\nContinuous Current: 500mA Max\nSR-1250 - 0 - 9 Pushwheel switch\nSR-1254 - End caps to suit (pair)\nSR-1256 - Spacer\n\n"}
