{"title": "3-32VDC Solid State 240VAC @ 3A Relay", "blurb": "This is a PCB mounting, single in line package relay capable of switching up to 240V AC at 3 amps. Solid state relays are particularly useful when only low switching currents are available, such as those presented by CMOS or TTL circuits. Optically isolated for optimum safety, the relays feature high surge ratings to allow lamp and motor switching plus zero voltage turn- on and zero current turn off to minimise EMI and RFI emissions. Use this relay in conjunction with our remote control switches for safe 240V AC mains switching.\n\n"}
