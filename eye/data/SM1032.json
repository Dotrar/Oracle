{"title": "Tubular Key Change Over Keyswitch", "blurb": "This keyswitch uses tubular keys with black plastic inserts to easily identify them. It has 2 positions and the key is removable from both. There are 4 connection terminals, however, it is not a regular Double Pole Single Throw (DPST) switch, but rather a dual Single Pole Single Throw (SPST) change-over switch as each pair of contacts is in the opposite state to the other.\n\n"}
