{"title": "3 Pin 0.1 Header with Crimp Pins - 2.54 pitch", "blurb": "A range of connectors for PCB mounting that allow circuit boards to be plugged together at right angles or end-to-end, or cables to be plugged onto circuit boards at right angles or end-on at the edge of the PCB. Both plugs and sockets may be butted up end-to-end to form connectors with any number of ways from 2 upwards.\nBoth plugs are wafer design into which square, tin-plated brass pins have been inserted. These pins protrude 3.4mm on one side, and should be soldered to the PCB. The nylon wafer sits on the PCB and is 3.3mm thick. The back provides locking and polarising.\nNormal force: \t200g min\nHousing: \tUL 94v-0 white nylon\nTemperature: \t0 to +75\u00b0C\n\n"}
