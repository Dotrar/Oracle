{"title": "15A SPST Marine Toggle Switch", "blurb": "This large toggle switch is specially designed for marine conditions. A weatherproof rubber boot covers the actuator, and the switch mechanism is encapsulated in rubber. For this reason, 150mm fly leads are attached instead of the usual terminals. Not only limited to marine use, it can also be used as an ultra-durable switch in many applications\n\n"}
