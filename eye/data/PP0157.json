{"title": "6.5mm PRO METAL Mono Plug", "blurb": "These plugs are made especially for the rigours of the road or anywhere where a heavy duty, tough 6.5mm plug is called upon. The mono plugs feature blue identification rings, where as the stereo plugs have black rings. This is particularly handy if you have a combination of stereo and mono plugs on the one mixing desk or patch bay.\n\n"}
