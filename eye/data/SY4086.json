{"title": "Solid State Relay 4-32VDC Input, 30VDC 100A Switching", "blurb": "This panel mount solid state relay offers 4 -32VDC input control, with a switched output rated at 30VDC/ 100Amps. Note, please refer to the data sheet; especially the Precautions 1, 2, 3 and 4 and make sure the heat sink size is adequate for high current loads. Switching high current DC loads normally requires use of a contactor to avoid arcing as the contacts try to separate. This solid state relay uses MOSFET technology to provide an economical and reliable method of switching medium to high power DC loads. This means there is no arcing and the low on-state resistance provides a viable alternative to the bulky and expensive contactors.\nNote: Inductive loads must have diode suppression (Refer data sheet wiring diagram)\nOutput Circuit\n\u2022 Load Voltage: 0-30VDC\n\u2022 Load Current: 0.02-100A\n\u2022 Max On-State Resistance: 0.007Ohms\n\u2022 Max On-State Voltage Drop: 0.35V\n\u2022 Max Turn On Time: 0.5ms\n\u2022 Max Turn Off Time: 0.5ms\n\u2022 Max Surge Current: 240A (10ms)\nInput Circuit\n\u2022 Control Voltage: 4-32VDC\n\u2022 Control Current: 28mA max.\n\u2022 Min Turn Off Voltage: 1.0VDC\n\u2022 Input Resistance: 1.2kOhm\n\n"}
