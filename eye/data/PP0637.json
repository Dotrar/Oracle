{"title": "F59 TYPE TWIST-ON Plug - RG-59 Cable", "blurb": "Simply strip coax back about 12mm, fold braid/foil back over the plastic outer sheath. Trim about 8mm of foam insulation from centre conductor. Then simply screw the knurled connector on the cable until you see sufficient centre conductor out of the front of the connector. The foam insulation will centrally locate this conductor. If necessary, trim some surplus braid and foil beforehand to stop the screw thread from binding. Only a small amount of braid is needed to achieve sound electrical connection. Trim excess braid from knurled end and for a really neat job pop some heatshrink over the lot.\n\n"}
